# Game title is "100 TO WIN!"
# You control a robot who can move left and right across the bottom of the screen
# Use left and right arrow keys to control robot
# Coins randomly rain down from the sky along with monsters
# Collect the coins and avoid the monsters. Coins are worth 1 point each
# The game speeds up the more coins you collect
# You start with 6 lives. If you hit a monster you lose a life.

This game was the final project for my Python MOOC online at the University of Helsinki.
